### MyReads Project

## Project Overview:

For the **MyReads Project** I used React to create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasized using React to build the application. An API server and client library were provided to persist information as you interact with the application.

## Running the Project:

fork or clone the repository
run npm install and npm start within the project

View the project by opening localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Resources:

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
